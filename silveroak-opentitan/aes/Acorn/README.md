# AES Silver Oak Implementation

## Baseline OpenTitan version for comparison
We must use the snapshot of the OpenTitan source from 11 May 2020 as the baseline reference implementation
at commit hash [783edaf444](https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan/tree/783edaf444eb0d9eaf9df71c785089bffcda574e) on the OpenTitan GitHub repo. For consistency and to allow us to produce a single FPGA implementation we should design and verify all our Silver Oak OpenTitan
components against this OpenTitan commit hash.
