This module explains how overloaded circuit descriptions work
in Lava for both circuit simulation and nelist generation, with
the use of mdo-syntax for capturing the use of MonadFix for bending
wires from the output back to the input.

-- The Lava class abstracts over a monad `m` that is based on MonadFix
-- and a type `bit` that represents the values that flow over wires.
-- For circuit simulation `bit` is [Bool], and for netlist generation
-- the `bit` type will be `State NetlistState` which builds up a circuit
-- graph using the state monad.
